TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a text mining technique used to categorize documents. Have you ever looked at blog posts on a web site, and wondered if it is possible to generate the tags automatically? Well, that's exactly the kind of problem TF-IDF is suited for.
It is worth noting the differences between TF-IDF and sentiment analysis. Although both could be considered classification techniques for text, their goals are distinct. On the one hand, sentiment analysis aims to classify documents into opinions such as 'positive' and 'negative'. On the other hand, TF-IDF classifies documents into categories inside the documents themselves. This would give insight about what the reviews are about, rather than if the author was happy or unhappy. If we analyzed product review data from an e-commerce site selling computer parts, we would end up with groups of documents about 'laptop', 'mouse', 'keyboard', etc. We would gain a large amount of data about the types of reviews that had been written, but would not learn anything about what the users thought of those products. Although the algorithms are similar in that they classify text, the results of each give us unique insights.
